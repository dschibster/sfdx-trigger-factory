# SFDX Trigger Factory

The SFDX Trigger Factory Framework is the trigger pattern in use in most organizations that are being consulted by mindsquare AG. It is meant to be scalable from very small adjustments and automations to big, enterprise-level patterns. Due to the Trigger Framework only delivering logistics, its possible to add logic wherever you see fit. 

Additonally, the trigger factory works off of Custom Metadata to fire its triggers, which means that your development teams can work agnostically from each other, e.g. for different Record Types for each object, enabling package-based development without dependency issues.

See in the sidebar this documentation on what this framework can and can't do, and how to use it to the fullest.
